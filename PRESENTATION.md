##How to Test a Screen Reader
Built into the OS: Mac & Windows

##Basic things to consider when developing
Lot's of stuff we already do as Frontenders...

###Document and Structure...
Landmarks
![search landmark](voice-over/landmarks.png)
![aside](voice-over/complimentary.png)

Checkpoint Level A 3.1.1 - Language of page
```html
<html lang="en">
```

Level AA 1.4.4 - Resize Text. 
Allows mobile users to pinch an zoom to increase readability.
```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scale=no" />
```

Level A 1.4.1 - User should be able to increase text up to 200%
Use relative CSS units: rem or em.

Level A 1.3.1 - Info and Relationships
Chunck content into landmarks. Users with assistive technologies use this to navigate: 
header, nav, main, footer, aside. 
One ```<main>```, one ```<h1>``` per page.

###Lists
Level A 1.3.1 - Info and Relationships:
Use Lists: 
```html
<ol><ul><dl>
```
Benefits for screen readers:
Discoverable, Type of List, Total Items, Item Index

![list](voice-over/list.png)

###Navigation and Skip Links
Level A 2.4.1 - Bypass Blocks: 
Add a Skip Link to main content
```html
<a class="skip-link" href="#main">Skip to main</a>...
<main id="main">
```
![skip to main](voice-over/skip-to-main.png)

Level A 2.4.4 - Link Purpose:
```html
<a href="#">Read More <span class="visuallyHidden"> on our products page</span></a>
```
![read more](voice-over/read-more.png)

Level AA 2.4.5 - Muliple Ways 
Provide more than one way to locate a page on the site. Either via Search or a Sitemap.
```html
<form action="/search" method="POST" role="search">
```
"search" is a landmark role making it easy for screen readers.

###Forms
Do not zero out the CSS Outline property. Just use CSS to give it a better glow.

####Error Summary
Level AA 3.3.3 - Error Suggestion: 
Make a place where a summary of errors will be generated. Then create a list of links that navigate the user to those fields.
```html
<section id="errors" aria-live="assertive" tabindex="-1"></section>
```

Level A 1.4.1 - Use of Color: 
Color is not used as the only visual means of conveying information. 
Example: When a form errors, don't just put a red border on the fields that error. Say something as well.

10% of Men are Color Blind
75% of those are red/green deficient. They have a hard time distinguishing these colors from each other.
If we use Red to indicate invalid fields, and Green to indicate valid ones. Then, yeah...

####Inputs
Bad Practice:
```html
<input id="name" type="text" name="name" placeholder="Name" />
```

Good Practice:
Level A 4.1.2 - Name, Role, Value
```html
<label for="name" aria-live="assertive">
    Name (Required):
    <span class="error-message visuallyHidden">Name cannot be empty</span>
</label>
<input id="name" type="text" name="name" required aria-invalid="true" />
```

####Fieldsets
Bad Practice:
```html
<input type="radio" type="phone-type" name="home"> Home
<input type="radio" type="phone-type" name="home"> Work
```

Good Practice:
```html
<fieldset>
    <legend>Phone Number Type</legend><!--Legend is announced after every focused element for a screen reader-->
    <label><input type="radio" type="phone-type" name="home"> Home</label>
    <label><input type="radio" type="phone-type" name="work"> Work</label>
</fieldset>
```

![fieldset](voice-over/fieldset.png)

###Media
Level A 1.1.1 - Non-text Content: 
All non-text content that is presented tot he user has a text alternative that serves the equivalent purpose.

Images: 
* Use real text instead of images.
* Screenreaders only show the file name of an image if no alt text is provided. 
* Omit the alt text value (alt="") if the image is just decoration.
* Don't describe image literally.
* Instead, describe the meaning or purpose of the image.

SVG: 
    Add ```role="img"```
    Use the ```<title>``` tag
    Use ```aria-labelledby``` referencing the title

![hero image](voice-over/hero-image.png)

###Tables
Use table grouping: thead, tfoot, tbody
Avoid complex tables: Not great experience for screen readers.
![tables](voice-over/table.png)

###RWD
Off screen content, meaning: left-100% is still focusable in the screenreader. To make it not focusable, make it display none. Just because you dont see it, doesnt mean that it on the screen reader.
